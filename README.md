# 💳 Credit Card Fraud Detection

## 📌 Project Overview

This project builds a Machine Learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. Fraud detection is a real-world classification problem with extremely imbalanced data, making it more complex than regular prediction tasks.

The goal is to identify fraudulent transactions accurately while minimizing false negatives.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Handle extreme class imbalance
- Train a robust classification model
- Evaluate performance using proper classification metrics
- Focus on improving fraud recall and F1-score

## 📊 Dataset Information

Dataset: Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset (European cardholders)

- Total transactions: 284,807
- Fraud cases: 492 (~0.17%)
- Features:
  - V1 to V28 (PCA transformed features)
  - Time
  - Amount
- Target variable:
  - 0 → Genuine transaction
  - 1 → Fraud transaction

⚠️ The dataset is highly imbalanced, so accuracy alone is not a reliable metric.

## 🔎 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The following visualizations were performed:

- Class distribution countplot
- Fraud vs Genuine percentage pie chart
- Transaction amount distribution
- Fraud vs Genuine boxplot comparison
- Correlation heatmap
- Confusion matrix visualization
- Feature importance plot

### Key Insights

- Fraud transactions represent less than 0.2% of total data.
- Severe class imbalance required special handling.
- Certain PCA components contribute more significantly to fraud detection.

## ⚙️ Data Preprocessing

- Scaled `Time` and `Amount` using StandardScaler
- Split dataset into training and testing sets (80/20)
- Used stratified sampling to preserve class distribution
- Applied SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) to handle imbalance

## 🤖 Model Used

### Random Forest Classifier

Random Forest was selected because:

- Handles non-linear relationships effectively
- Performs well on imbalanced datasets
- Provides feature importance insights
- Improves recall for minority class

---

## 📈 Model Performance

### Test Set Results

- Accuracy: 99.97%
- Fraud Precision: 94%
- Fraud Recall: 88%
- Fraud F1-Score: 91%

### Confusion Matrix

|               | Predicted Genuine | Predicted Fraud |
|--------------|------------------|----------------|
| Actual Genuine | 48,632 | 5 |
| Actual Fraud   | 11 | 77 |

### Interpretation

- The model detected 88% of fraudulent transactions.
- Very low false positive rate (only 5 genuine transactions misclassified).
- Recall was prioritized to minimize financial risk.
